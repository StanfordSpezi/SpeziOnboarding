/// Navigation Stack of Onboarding Views.
///
/// The `OnboardingStack` wraps a SwiftUI `NavigationStack` and provides an easy to use API to declare the onboarding steps of health applications,
/// eliminating the need for developers to manually determine the next to be shown step within each onboarding view (e.g. skipped steps as permissions are already granted).
/// All of the (conditional) onboarding views are stated within the `OnboardingStack` from which the order of the onboarding flow is determined.
///
/// Navigation within the `OnboardingStack` is possible via the ``OnboardingNavigationPath`` which works quite similar to the SwiftUI `NavigationPath`.
/// It automatically navigates to the next to-be-shown onboarding step via ``OnboardingNavigationPath/nextStep()`` or manually via  ``OnboardingNavigationPath/append(_:)``.
/// Furthermore, one can append custom onboarding steps that are not declared within the  `OnboardingStack`
/// (e.g. as the structure of these steps isn't linear) via ``OnboardingNavigationPath/append(customView:)``.
/// See the ``OnboardingNavigationPath`` for more details.
///
/// The ``OnboardingNavigationPath`` is injected as an `Observable` into the environment of the `OnboardingStack` view hierarchy.
/// Resulting from that, all views declared within the `OnboardingStack` are able to access a single instance of the ``OnboardingNavigationPath``.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Onboarding: View {
///     @AppStorage(StorageKeys.onboardingFlowComplete) var completedOnboardingFlow = false
///     @State private var localNotificationAuthorization = false
///
///     var body: some View {
///         OnboardingStack(onboardingFlowComplete: $completedOnboardingFlow) {
///             Welcome()
///             InterestingModules()
///
///             if HKHealthStore.isHealthDataAvailable() {
///                 HealthKitPermissions()
///             }
///
///             if !localNotificationAuthorization {
///                 NotificationPermissions()
///             }
///         }
///         .task {
///             localNotificationAuthorization = await ...
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Identifying Onboarding Views
///
/// Apply the ``SwiftUICore/View/onboardingIdentifier(_:)`` modifier to clearly identify a view in the `OnboardingStack`.
/// This is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple instances of the same view type might appear in the stack.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Onboarding: View {
///     @AppStorage(StorageKeys.onboardingFlowComplete) var completedOnboardingFlow = false
///
///     var body: some View {
///         OnboardingStack(onboardingFlowComplete: $completedOnboardingFlow) {
///             MyOwnView()
///                 .onboardingIdentifier("my-own-view-1")
///             MyOwnView()
///                 .onboardingIdentifier("my-own-view-2")
///             // Other views as needed
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Note: When the ``SwiftUICore/View/onboardingIdentifier(_:)`` modifier is applied multiple times to the same view, the outermost identifier takes precedence.
