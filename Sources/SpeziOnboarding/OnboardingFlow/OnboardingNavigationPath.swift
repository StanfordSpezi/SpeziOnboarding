// MARK: OnboardingNavigationPath

/// Describes the current navigation state of a `OnboardingStack`.
///
/// The `OnboardingNavigationPath` wraps SwiftUI's `NavigationPath` and tailors it for the use within the ``OnboardingStack``
/// which provides an easy-to-use interface for creating Onboarding Flows within health applications.
///
/// At the core of the `OnboardingNavigationPath` stands a wrapped `NavigationPath` from SwiftUI.
/// Based on the onboarding views and conditions defined within the ``OnboardingStack``, the ``OnboardingNavigationPath``
/// enables developers to easily navigate through the onboarding procedure
/// without repeated condition checking in every single onboarding view.
///
/// The `OnboardingNavigationPath` is injected as an `Observable` into the Environment of the ``OnboardingStack`` view hierarchy.
/// Resulting from that, all views declared within the ``OnboardingStack`` are able to access a single instance of the `OnboardingNavigationPath`.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Welcome: View {
///     @Environment(OnboardingNavigationPath.self) private var onboardingNavigationPath
///
///     var body: some View {
///         OnboardingView(
///             ...,
///             action: {
///                 // Navigates to the next onboarding step, as defined in `OnboardingStack` closure.
///                 onboardingNavigationPath.nextStep()
///
///                 // Navigates to the next onboarding step that matches the provided view type.
///                 onboardingNavigationPath.append(InterestingModules.self)
///
///                 // Navigate to a manually injected view. The `OnboardingNavigationPath` won't be moved and stay at the old position.
///                 onboardingNavigationPath.append(customView: SomeCustomView())
///             }
///         )
///     }
/// }
/// ```
