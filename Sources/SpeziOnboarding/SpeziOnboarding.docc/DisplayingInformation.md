Display information to your user during an onboarding flow.

## OnboardingView

The <doc:OnboardingView> allows you to separate information into areas on a screen, each with a title, description, and icon.

The following example demonstrates how the above view is constructed:

```swift
OnboardingView(
    title: "Welcome",
    subtitle: "Spezi UI Tests",
    areas: [
        .init(
            icon: Image(systemName: "tortoise.fill"), 
            title: "Tortoise", 
            description: "A Tortoise!"
        ),
        .init(
            icon: Image(systemName: "lizard.fill"), 
            title: "Lizard", 
            description: "A Lizard!"
        ),
        .init(
            icon: Image(systemName: "tree.fill"), 
            title: "Tree", 
            description: "A Tree!"
        )
    ],
    actionText: "Learn More",
    action: {
        // Action to perform when the user taps the action button.
    }
)
```

## SequentialOnboardingView

The <doc:SequentialOnboardingView> allows you to display information step-by-step, with each additional area appearing when the user taps the `Continue` button.

The following example demonstrates how the above view is constructed:

```swift
SequentialOnboardingView(
    title: "Things to know",
    subtitle: "And you should pay close attention ...",
    content: [
        .init(
            title: "A thing to know", 
            description: "This is a first thing that you should know; read carefully!"
        ),
        .init(
            title: "Second thing to know", 
            description: "This is a second thing that you should know; read carefully!"
        ),
        .init(
            title: "Third thing to know", 
            description: "This is a third thing that you should know; read carefully!"
        )
    ],
    actionText: "Continue"
) {
    // Action to perform when the user has viewed all the steps
}
```
